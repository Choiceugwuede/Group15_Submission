# Project Overview  

This project is in partial fulfilment of the Core Data Engineers Bootcamp under the **SQL, Git, and Linux Module**.  

The task is to help the Core Data Engineering (CDE) team gain a deeper understanding of their competitor, **Parch & Posey**. To achieve this, we conducted an exploratory analysis of Posey's database tables. The analysis provides insights into their market operations, sales performance, and customer behavior, serving as a foundation for informed decision-making.
